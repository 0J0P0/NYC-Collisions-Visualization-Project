## Project 1: Collisions in NYC - Summer Analysis 2018 & 2020

### Introduction
The project aims to analyze collision data in New York City specifically focusing on the summers of 2018 and 2020. The objective is to create a static visualization that addresses various questions such as the frequency of accidents during weekdays vs. weekends, identifying vehicle types involved in accidents, time of day when accidents are more common, areas with a higher number of accidents, and potential correlations between weather conditions and accidents.

### Objectives and Approach
- **Data Analysis:** Utilize collision datasets from 2018 and 2020 along with weather data and NYC map information.
- **Data Processing:** Perform data cleaning and derivation using tools like OpenRefine and Python (Pandas).
- **Visualization Design:** Develop a multi-view static visualization using altair and Streamlit. The design process will involve careful consideration of chart types (e.g., bar charts, line charts, heat maps) and visual cues for clear interpretation.
- **Delivery:** The deliverables will include clean datasets, Colab document detailing data cleaning steps, Python code for visualization, and clear instructions for reproducing steps.

### Key Deliverables
- Clean datasets (raw and processed)
- Detailed Colab document with cleaning and visualization design steps
- Python file containing Streamlit code for the final visualization

### Deadline and Grading Criteria
- Deadline: 17th November
- Grading based on the complexity of visualizations, inclusion of new derived variables, and the ability to solve non-trivial tasks through the visualization tool.

### Important Remarks
- Emphasis on consistent effort and thorough work rather than minimal completion.
- Clear communication and documentation of steps taken in both data cleaning and visualization design.

## Project 2: Deeper Analysis of NYC Collisions in 2018

### Introduction
Building upon the cleaned dataset from the previous project focused on collisions in NYC during 2018, this project aims to create an interactive visualization with multiple views. The goal is to allow users to answer specific questions related to the predominant weather conditions, vehicle types, accident locations, and times for each month and across all months of 2018.

### Objectives and Approach
- **Data Utilization:** Reuse the cleaned dataset from the previous project along with additional weather data and categorization of vehicle types.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Develop an interactive multi-view visualization using Streamlit.
- **Design Process:** Thoughtful design iteration to create a single visualization providing insights into various accident-related queries specified.
- **Delivery:** Provide clear instructions, along with the code and dataframes, to ensure reproducibility.

### Key Deliverables
- Weather dataset (weather2018.csv), previously cleaned collision dataset, and NY map
- Streamlit-based interactive visualization
- Detailed documentation showcasing the design process and steps leading to the final visualization

### Deadline and Grading Criteria
- Deadline: As per project guidelines
- Grading based on the effectiveness of the interactive visualization, addressing specified questions with multiple views, and the design process illustrated in the documentation.

### Important Remarks
- Avoid repetition in visualizations for the same query across different months.
- Emphasis on a streamlined, intuitive user experience within the interactive visualization.
- Clear and comprehensive documentation of steps taken in designing the interactive visualizations.

These descriptions serve as a guide for the README file, outlining the objectives, approaches, deliverables, and evaluation criteria for both projects involving NYC collision data analysis.
