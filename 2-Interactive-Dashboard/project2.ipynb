This strategic approach was adopted to take advantage of the unique strengths and capabilities offered by each tool. OpenRefine facilitated initial data cleaning and transformation tasks, with its user-friendly interface for effective manipulation of datasets. Simultaneously, Python libraries were utilized to perform more complex data operations and manipulations, with special emphasis on the extensive functionalities and flexibility they provide. This combination allowed for a comprehensive preprocessing workflow that maximized efficiency and accuracy in preparing the data for subsequent analyses and visualization tasks."

    "The initial step involved loading the original dataset into a `Pandas` dataframe, primarily to apply a date range filter efficiently. The rationale behind this approach was to optimize the data filtering process, considering the considerable size of the original dataset. The volume of data posed challenges within OpenRefine, leading to slow and inefficient computational processes. By filtering the dataset using `Pandas`, it allowed for a more streamlined and quicker selection of the desired date range. Following this initial filtering phase, the refined dataset was exported as a `.csv` file (`collisions-2018.csv`) and subsequently imported into OpenRefine for further data processing and cleaning procedures. This sequential approach ensured a balance between computational efficiency and data handling capabilities across both Pandas and OpenRefine, resulting in a more effective preprocessing workflow."
